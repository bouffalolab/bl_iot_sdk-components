## 2023-04-17
1. Fix disconnect error when call bt_conn_disconnect().
   Issue: when bt_conn_disconnect()->bt_hci_disconnect()->bt_hci_cmd_send_sync() is run, yeild will be called and current task is pending. Once disconnect done, conn->state will be changed to BT_CONN_DISCONNECTED and current task will be restored. Now if bt_conn_set_state() is called with parameter BT_CONN_DISCONNECT. conn->ref will be messed.
2. Fix crash when call bt_le_scan_stop().
   Issue: scan_dev_found_cb will be set to NULL in bt_le_scan_stop(). If bt_le_scan_stop() is called but scan has not been stopped immediately, le_adv_report() will call scan_dev_found_cb which leads to crash.
